# Changelog

v2.1.14 2022-09-29
- new expander module: SheepMore an extension for adding outputs to Sheep module
- bug fix with clock division of PushMeMore (random sequences & multi-trigger for others)
- new feature in PushmeSeq & PushmeMore (precision settings in context menu); I couldn't resist :)
- new feature in PushmeSeq, Celei, Celesta, Sheep (step calculation isn't affected by bypassing)
- minor bug fix in Celei for reset V levels
- new reversed output on FromTo
- bug fix in Sheep on the startup display

v2.1.13 2022-09-18
- new module added: Sheep (stepped voltage again)
- new expander module: PushMeMore an extension for adding tracks to PushMeSeq module
- adding first step indicator LED to SaveMeMono and SaveMeMonoWide to see the value of first step (I like drumpatterns with a first-hit-start)
- label fix in Quant12, and adding a trigger indicator LED
- clock indicator level set to 2.0V (instead of the previously coded 0.2V :> ) in Celei, Celesta, FromTo, PushMeSeq, Quant12, QuantET, RandVolt10, RandVolt8, RotaTrig, Sequin
- bug fix in RotaTrig CV step mode (0-10V)
- label fix and heavy code renovation in PushMe (Zone 6 labels corrected)
- minor enhancement of RandVolt8 (fixed voltages are from 0-7V and variable by the knob/switch)

v2.1.12 2022-08-20
- modifying descriptions and labels in QuantET, PushMe
- patch breaking change in QuantET MODE the order of options
- layout change of swapped sockets in QuantET
- new module added as RotaTrig (routing)
- new module added as FromTo (theMatrix stepper)
- new module added as Quant12 (quantizer)

v2.1.11 2022-08-10
- new module added as QuantET with variable equally distributed scales
- bug fix in Randvolt8 to show uni/bi switch values properly
- modifying description labels in SaveMeMono and SaveMeMonoWide

v2.1.10 2022-08-01
- new module added as RandVolt8 providing stepped/fixed voltages 
- new shortkey for Pushme to randomize all buttons ('R') including exclusive dice for the 3x16 mode and the 1x48 random mode
- bug fix in ChanSel2 to display channel number or CV value depending poly input availabilty
- new modules added as SaveMeMono (2HP) & SaveMeMonoWide (6HP) providing random voltages and 256 slots for saving a stepped voltage sequence
- significant enhancement to SeqP16 by adding the option to repeat certain steps

v2.1.9 2022-07-23
- contains a TRP1 bugfix
- contains a ChanSel 2 upgrade to snap the sliders if input is connected
- changed PushMe sequence modes (1x16+4x8 became 1x16+3x8+1x8 where the last track is random)
- new shortkeys for Pushme to record hits and clear zones
- new gate syncing feature in the context menu of Enveloops
- basic quantization is added to the context menu of Celei and Celesta

v2.1.8 2022-07-14
- contains NearMess mixer and Sequin sequencer

V2.1.7 2022-07-01
- contains Celesta and Celei sequencers
